# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-ANN

In the world of artificial neural networks (ANN), predicting gre admissions becomes an exciting application. Using ANN, I created a predictive model that learns patterns from historical data, considering factors such as GRE scores, GPA, and other relevant features. The network optimizes its parameters during training to make accurate predictions regarding the likelihood of admission.
